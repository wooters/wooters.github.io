### A few words for anyone who happens upon this site

1. If you choose to read these posts, please consider that you are reading communications written by past-me and intended for future-me. Future-me was the target audience. At the time of writing, past-me assumed that what future-me would find confusing or important is what past-me found confusing or important. So, please don't take offense at any overly simplistic or condescending undertones you find herein. And, for this same reason, you may find that context and background are missing.
2. I love to learn. If you find a mistake or have a suggestion, I'd consider it a gift if you'd share that with me. Thanks in advance kind teacher.
3. These are my words and don't reflect the thoughts or opinions of my current (or any past) employer, or anyone else.
4. These are not [notes _from_ my future-self](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=SdT7r1OXFQ0) :)
