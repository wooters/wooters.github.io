### A few words for anyone who happens upon this site

1. If you choose to read these posts, please consider that you are reading communications intended for my future self. So you may notice that context is lacking. Or non-existent.
2. I love to learn. If you find a mistake or have a suggestion, I'd love it if you'd share. Thanks in advance.
3. These are my words and don't reflect the thoughts or opinions of my current (or any past) employer, or anyone else.
4. These are not [notes _from_ my future-self](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=SdT7r1OXFQ0) :)
